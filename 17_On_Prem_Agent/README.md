# Build 🏗️

First, let's pull and run our DeepSeek-R1 distilled model through Ollama.

### Mac

1. Download the Ollama app for Mac [here](https://ollama.com/download).

2. Pull a local LLM from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). As an [example](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:8b):
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

### Windows

1. Download the Ollama app for Windows [here](https://ollama.com/download).

2. Pull a local LLM from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search). As an [example](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:8b):
```powershell
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

### Testing

Once you'd completed that task - please run the `test_ollama.ipynb` notebook to confirm your Ollama instance is working correctly. 

### Ollama Deep Research

Once you've completed that step - please clone the [Ollama Deep Research repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Ollama-Deep-Research-Modified) (outside of the AIE5 repository). 

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/Ollama-Deep-Research-Modified.git
```

Then you can follow the instructions in that README.md to launch the application. 

### Assignment: 

Add a local RAG instance powered by QDrant into the flow of the existing Agent. 

First, you'll need to: 

```bash
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

Then you will need to: 

1) Launch [QDrant through Docker](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quickstart/)
2) Create a VectorStore leveraging QDrant as a backend (you can use [this notebook](./qdrant_setup.ipynb) as inspiration)
3) Add a new node in the Agent Graph
4) Modify the graph to accomodate your new node. 

## ADVANCED BUILD:

Implement Semantic Caching with Redis (or similar solution), and add tracing through LangSmith, or WandB.
